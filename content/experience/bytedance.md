- Engineered a serverless RAG chatbot using Kitex RPC (Go) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to integrate complex, user-specific competition logic from multiple APIs. Orchestrated real-time RPC lookups to inject live database records
into the model, enabling the AI to answer context-heavy debugging queries that static documentation could not resolve.
- Automated the resolution of 62% of on-call tickets by deploying the chatbot onto the corporate messaging platform and as an embedded Next.js plugin in operator dashboards, creating a streamlined and cohesive incident response process.
