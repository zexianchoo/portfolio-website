title: "About Me"
---

Currently, I'm an incoming New Grad Backend Software Engineer at TikTok, speciically at TikTok Shop, where I will be building backend systems to support creators that sell products on TikTok Shop. My focus is on building the infrastructure that supports creator-led commerce, specifically designing the high-scale database and API layers that keep the ecosystem running. 

Previously, I interned as a DevOps engineer at Blizzard Entertainment, where I had hands-on experience building Kubernetes clusters and Helm charts, hence where the love for homelabbing came.

I like to think that I code for better reasons like coping with existential dread or to make money, but honestly I'm just a little too obsessed with building things. I confess that I do have periods of insanity.

During my TikTok internship. I would come home after work, eat whatever I got on the way home, and immediately open my laptop to improve my homelab, and suddenly it would be 2AM and I was losing sleep. And the worst part? This continued into the weekends too. 

I remember telling my friends that I might actually be mentally ill, because who the hell codes even more after coding at their job?

So yeah... That's probably what you'll find me doing on weekends.
