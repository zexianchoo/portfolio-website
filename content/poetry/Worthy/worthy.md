How can one see her face and stand unfazed?

The man within the slanted glass musters

A short and shameful breath which flowed like rain;

Expelled with greater urgency, cast out

With deep disdain. As April showers fall,

The May flowers bloom. And yet, as nature's

Cleanser reaches trembling hearts, it pools in vain.

Despite the hemorrhage, the weeds remain.
